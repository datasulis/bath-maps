				<h1>Bath Historical Maps</h1>

        <p>
        Bath has a long and interesting history. Historical maps can give us a window into that history, letting us explore how the city has changed and grown over the years.
        The earliest historical maps of the city date to the 16th and 17th century (the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset#Early_Modern">early modern</a>" period).
        </p>

        <p>
        Until recently the majority of these maps have only been accessible in offline archives or owned by private collectors. While some have been digitised they have not been made openly available, making
        it difficult for the majority of people to access them. Until now. 
        </p>

        <p>
        The British Library and B&NES council have recently published several digitised maps of Bath available online under an open licence. To make those maps useful and easy to 
        explore we've aligned the old maps with their modern equivalents so that you can explore them using <a href="https://www.google.com/earth/">Google Earth</a>. This means you 
        can now explore maps dating from 1572 from your own computer.
        </p>

        <p>
        We think this provides an amazing digital resource for local residents, teachers, historians or anyone with an interest in the history of Bath.</p> 

        <p>The following video provides a preview of what is now possible. As well as exploring individual maps to compare them with the model city, it is also possible 
        to compare individual maps, providing a fascinating way to explore the development of the city.</p>
        </p>

        <h2 id="access">Accessing the Maps</h2>

        <p>
        Firstly ensure that you have <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/earth/download/ge/agree.html">downloaded and installed Google Earth</a>.
        </p> 

        <p>
        Using the links in the table below, you can now load individual maps to add them as Google Earth layers. We've also created a download for a 
        that collects together <a href="https://maps.bathhacked.org/maps/all-maps.kml">all of the maps in a single Google Earth folder</a>. 
        This is the easiest way to load and explore all of the maps.
        </p>

        <p>
        Choose a link below. If your browser simply downloads the link to the map file rather opening Google Earth then find your downloads folder and 
        double-click on the downloaded file (called <code>doc.kml</code>) and it should then open up in Google Earth.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong> once you've loaded the maps into Google Earth, if you drag them from "Temporary Places" into "My Places" then they will be permanently 
        saved and will be available to you next time you open Google Earth.
        </p>

        To add some extra context to the maps, you can also download this additional layer which contains <a href="https://maps.bathhacked.org/maps/historical-bath.kml">historical videos, paintings and pictures</a>.

        <h2>Source Images and Data</h2>

        <p>
        The <a href="https://data.bathhacked.org/Heritage/Bath-Historical-Maps/iei5-h7uh">Bath Historical Maps</a> dataset in the Bath:Hacked data store contains some 
        additional metadata about the images, as well as pointers to the source images.
        </p>

        <p>
        We've packaged up each map into an archive that contains the original image(s) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georeference">georeferenced</a> TIFF files used to generate the Google Earth overlays.
        </p>

        <p>
        Developers may be interested to know that there are <a href="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification#TileMap_Resource">tilemap resource files</a> available for each map, 
        e.g. <a href="https://maps.bathhacked.org/maps/1891/tilemapresource.xml">for the 1891 map</a>. The additional configuration files to create a complete Tile Map Service will be added shortly.
        </p>
